# K-2L Resources Channel

We share a lot of URL's between us on our slack channel.  We decided to put them all into one place and frequently pull them out of Slack.  This is the first step towards that.

If you want to recreate this, you'll need to save a token.txt file containing your Slack API token [by going here](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens).

Feel free to go through and parse more information out.  This was just to get a first stab at it.
